Run command ```pip install marimo``` to first install needed marimo dependency. Project can then be run using command ```marimo run CS513_Final_Project.py``` if user has ```flight_delay_predict.csv``` file in the same folder. Doing this should open up a ```localhost:2718``` tab in your browser where model graphs are displayed. Extra information is also displayed in the terminal in the IDE used to run the project. 
WARNING: Code for hierarchal clustering expected to take over 10+ minutes to run, to reduce time decrease the used data size to a small number on lines 741 and 742.
